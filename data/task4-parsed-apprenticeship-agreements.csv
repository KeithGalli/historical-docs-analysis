I have four children who have been bound out without my knowledge and consent.

Maj. Hay: 
A negro woman by the name of Harris, (I think Eliza Harris) applied to me this week, to institute proceedings in Court, for the purpose of having her child, a boy, now eight years of age restored to her. I filed her affidavit in which she made oath to the following facts; ""that John Stallings of Franklin County, her former owner, took her child & without her knowledge or consent, carried him to Louisburg, & had him bound to him as an apprentice until his arrival to the age of twenty one years; that she is now the wife of Harris (a freedman) who is fully able to support her child, & is willing to do so; and that he is a proper person to have charge of her son. 
 
Upon this affidavit, I moved the court for a rule upon Mr Stallings to show cause why the indentures of apprenticeship should not be canceled. The court refused to grant the rule, upon the ground that the boy was bound to Stallings by the ""Freedmans Bureau"" and not by the Court. Can you interfere in this matter, and offer this woman any relief in her distress? If so, please inform me.  
 
Very respectfully,  
L.C. Edwards  ","{
